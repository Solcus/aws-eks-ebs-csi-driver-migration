1. migration from any SC to any SC 
(works! - tested back and forth between gp2, aws-ebs-gp2 and aws-ebs-gp3)

2. snapshot during traffic 
(works, but about 30 seconds of datagap -> solution is to down/upscale the cluster resources)

3. restore broken pvc after migration 
(works! pvc manifest is stored in backup - can be reattached to snapshot - no dataloss)

4. downscale clusters deployments/statefulsets to 0 
(works! stores a backup of original replica counts - works on namespace base level)

5. upscale clusters deployments/statefulsets to original replica counts 
(works! restores original replica counts based on backupfile)

6. migration with downscaled cluster 
(works like a charm)

7. data persistence after upscaled cluster 
(works! - no dataloss)


8. migrate without pod recreation
(fail! - without pod recreation, it cannot find the new volume
the pod recreation however, works in a rolling update fashion, so in case there is more then 1 replica, there doesnt have to be any downtime.
The pod recreation works fine.)
